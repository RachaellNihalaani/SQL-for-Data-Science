## What is SQL?
1.	Stands for Structured Query Language
2.	Pronounced as ‘sequel’ or ‘S-Q-L’
3.	It is a standard computer language for Relational Database Management and Data Manipulation



## How is SQL different from other computer languages?
1.	Statements in SQL are made up of descriptive words and are easy to learn.
2.	SQL is a non-procedural language:
a.	It cannot write complete applications, it can only interact with data.
b.	It is simple, but powerful.



## How is SQL used?
1.	SQL is used to communicate with the database
  -	Read/ Retrieve/ Query data
  - Write data: add data to the table
  - Update/ Modify data: insert new data



## Who uses SQL?
1.	Backend Developers
2.	ETL Developers
3.	QA Engineers
4.	System Engineers
5.	System Admin
6.	Database Admin
7.	Data Architect
8.	Data Analyst
9.	Data Scientist



## What is the difference between Database Administrators and Data Scientists?
| Database Administrator    | Data Scientist       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Manages/ governs entire DB| End user of database |
| Gives permission to users	|                      |
| Determines access to data	|                      |
| Manages and creates tables|                      |
Both of them use SQL to query and review data

## How do Data Scientists use SQL?
1.	Retrieve Data (Main use)
2.	May create their own table or test environment
3.	Combine multiple sources together
4.	Writes complex queries for analysis

## SQL and Relational Database Management Systems
1.	How you write syntax will depend on what DBMS you are using
2.	Popular Relational Database Management Systems:
  - Microsoft SQL server
  - MySQL
  - IBM DB2 Oracle
  - Apache Open Office Base
  - Sybase ASE
  - SQLite
  - PostgreSQL
